   <p><b>Connexions</b> is a collaborative, <?= Connexions::wikipedia_a('Social_bookmarking', 'social bookmarking') ?>/<?= Connexions::wikipedia_a('Social_bookmarking#Folksonomy', 'folksonomy') ?> system.  It is similar to del.icio.us, simply, furl, and BlinkList.  Connexions provides an attractive, easy to use interface that allows individuals to tag anything that has a unique identifier (e.g. a URL, URI) with one or more keywords.  Tagged items can then be located based upon tags and/or the individuals that tagged them.  The system also permits users to rate the quality of items, mark items as shared or private, and indicate which items are favorites.</p>
   <p class='continued'>Storing your bookmarks in connexions provided a number of benefits:</p>
   <ul class='outer'>
    <li>Your bookmarks are available anywhere you have access to connexions, not limited to the browser you originally used to create the bookmark;</li>
    <li>You can share your bookmarks publically so your friends, coworkers, and any others can view them for reference or collaboration.  Of course, if you would rather, you can mark your bookmarks as private, making them viewable only by you.  The decision is yours;</li>
    <li>All public bookmarks are always visible, along with a count of how many people have bookmarked the same item.  This allows your to find new information that may also be of interest to you.  That's the power of the social aspect of connexions!</li>

  <div class='help-content faq-answer'>
   <p><b>Social bookmarking</b> is "a method for users to organize, store, manage and search for bookmarks of resources online.  Unline file sharing, the <i>resources</i> themselves aren't shared, merly bookmarks that <i>reference</i> them." <sup>[<?= Connexions::wikipedia_a('Social_bookmarking', 'wikipedia') ?>]</sup></p>
   <p>In addition to saving references to online resources, connexions also allows bookmarks to contain a textual description, rating, be marked private and/or favorite, as well as have one or more tags associated with them.</p>
   <p>The tags associated with bookmarks are what make connexions a <?= Connexions::wikipedia_a('Folksonomy', 'folksonomy') ?>, allowing users to determine the form of organization required for their needs.  There is no forced heirarchy of terms that users must learn.  They are free to create their own as individuals, as ad-hoc collaborative groups, or even as structured groups.  It's completely up to the users.</p>

  <div class='help-content faq-answer'>
   <p><b>Tags</b> are "non-heirarchical keywords or terms assigned to ... a bookmark" <sup>[<?= Connexions::wikipedia_a('Tag_(metadata)', 'wikipedia') ?>]</sup></p>
   <p>They are primarily used to attach simple, memorable, meaningful words or concepts to a bookmark.  This helps to later locate the sites you have bookmarked and provides a natural grouping of sites that you have determined have similarities.</p>
