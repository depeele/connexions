<div class='helpAnswer'>
 <b>Connexions</b> is a collaborative, social bookmarking/folksonomy system
 developed by the D. Elmo Peele. It is similar to del.icio.us, simpy and
 BlinkList and provides an attractive, easy to use interface that allows
 individuals to tag anything that has a unique identifier (e.g. a URL, URI)
 with one or more keywords. Tagged items can then be located based upon tags
 and/or the individuals that tagged them. The system also permits users to rate
 the quality of items, mark items shared or private, and indicate which items
 are favorites.

<a name='What is social bookmarking'><div class='helpQuestion'>What is social bookmarking?</div></a>
<div class='helpAnswer'>
 Connexions is a <b>social bookmarking</b> site.  This means that it is
 designed to allow you to store and share bookmarks on the web instead of
 inside your browser.  This has several advantages:
 <ul>
  <li>you can get to your bookmarks from anywhere you have access to
  connexions</li>

  <li>you can share your bookmarks publically so your friends, coworkers, and
  others can view them for reference or collaboration.  <i>Note that you can
  also mark connexions bookmarks as private (only viewable by you) if you
  wish.</i></li>

  <li>you can see the public bookmarks that everyone else using connexions have
  made, along with a count of how many people have found a particular item
  interesting.  This allows you to locate items that may also interest you.</li>

 </ul>

<a name='What are tags'><div class='helpQuestion'>What are tags?</div></a>
<div class='helpAnswer'>
 <b>Tags</b> are simple descriptors that can be assigned to any bookmark in
 connexions.  They are similar to keywords but are non-hierarchical.  You can
 assign as many tags to a bookmark as you like and easily rename or delete them
 later.  Tagging can be a lot easier and more flexible than fitting your
 information into preconceived categories or folders.
