Optimizations:
    - Allow queries without stats;
    - For queries that may be counted and also involve sub-selects, expand the
      sub-selects immediately and use the results directly in a new, optimized
      query;
    - Leverage the "dirty" status available for all fields in a
      Connexions_Model, particularly during update();

meta ==> stats

displayStyle == list of on/off with predefined sets (e.g. regular, full).

always render all parts, just hide some?

easy mapping between displayStyle choices and CSS selectors.

show displayStyle changes immediately instead of re-rendering
(since displayStyle doesn't effect sort order, this should be trivial if we
 always render all parts of a bookmark);
