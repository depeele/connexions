Groups of users, items, or tags:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Groups have two parts:
        - a set of users that are members of the group, and are thus effected
          by 'control' and 'visibility';

        - a set of items that are being grouped together, whose 'visibility' is
          controlled by the group;

    A group refers to exactly one 'type':
        user    - a grouping of users that allows those to whom the group is
                  visible to view all public userItems created by any user
                  referenced in the itemGroup table;

                    Related Users, Network, Watchlist, Friends, Coworkers, ...

                    Every user has one, non-transferrable user-group named:
                        '<userName>'


        item    - a grouping of items that allows those to whom the group is
                  visible to view all public userItems that reference any item
                  referenced in the itemGroup table;

                    Related Items, ...


        tag     - a grouping of tags that allows those to whom the group is
                  visible to view all public userItems with any tag referenced
                  in the itemGroup table;

                    Related Tags, Tag bundles, ...

                    Every user has one, non-transferrable, non-editable
                    tag-group named:
                        '@<userName>'   - the user's inbox, implicitly refers
                                          to the '@<userName>' tag


    group
    -----
        groupId     - unique database id

        name        - unique group name

        type        - type of items in this group:
                        'user', 'item', 'tag'

        control     - who can add/delete members:items:
                                            (only 'owner' can change)
                        value : meaning
                        ------+-----------------------------------------------
                        owner : owner only
                        group : any group member (in addition to the owner)

                        Combinations:
                            owner:owner -- owner   can add/delete members,
                                           owner   can add/delete items
                            owner:group -- owner   can add/delete members,
                                           members can add/delete items
                            group:group -- members can add/delete members,
                                           members can add/delete items
                            group:owner -- members can add/delete members,
                                           owner   can add/delete items

                        Note: Only those who can add/delete members to this
                              group can explicitly view the list of members.


        visibiility - who can view items in this group:
                                            (only 'owner' can change)
                        value   : meaning
                        --------+---------------------------------------------
                        private : owner only
                        group   : group members
                        public  : anyone


        canTransfer - can this group be transferd by the owner?

        ownerId     - userId of owner
                        if 'canTransfer' is false, cannot be changed
                        else owner can change this
                             this is transfering ownership of a group



    userGroup / member / groupMember    - identify members of a 'group'
    --------------------------------
        userId      - userId  of this member

        groupId     - groupId of the target group



    itemGroup       - identify items of a 'user|item|tag' group
    ---------
        itemId      - depending on group.type, the id of the contained
                      user, item, or tag

        groupId     - groupId of the containing group



Examples:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    A user's network / watchlist:
        name        == user's name
        type        == 'user'
        control     == 'owner:*'    -- the member portion is unchangagle
        visibility  == any value
        canTransfer == false
        ownerId     == user's userId

        This is a user's network / watchlist / friend list.  It is a grouping
        of users that allows those to whom the group is visible to view all
        public userItems created by any user referenced in the itemGroup table.


    A group of users:
        name        == Unique, user supplied name
        type        == 'user'
        control     == any combination
        visibility  == any value
        canTransfer == true
        ownerId     == Creating user's userId

        This is a grouping of users that allows those to whom the group is
        visible to view all public userItems created by any user referenced in
        the itemGroup table.


    A group of items:
        name        == Unique, user supplied name
        type        == 'item'
        control     == any combination
        visibility  == any value
        canTransfer == true
        ownerId     == Creating user's userId

        This is a grouping of items that allows those to whom the group is
        visible to view all public userItems that reference any item referenced
        in the itemGroup table.


    A group of tags:
        name        == Unique, user supplied name
        type        == 'tag'
        control     == any combination
        visibility  == any value
        canTransfer == true
        ownerId     == Creating user's userId

        This is a grouping of tags that allows those to whom the group is
        visible to view all public userItems with any tag referenced in the
        itemGroup table.
