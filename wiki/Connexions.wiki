Connexions is a tagging/folksonomy system similar to del.icio.us, simpy, furl, or BlinkList.


= Requirements/Dependencies =

A web server that supports PHP (4 or higher), local .htaccess files, and the mod_rewrite URL rewriting engine.

A modern browser that supports JavaScript (1.5 or higher) and asynchronous HTTP requests.  This would include Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 or higher, Mozilla Firefox 1.0/Mozilla 1.7 or higher, and Apple Safari 1.2 or higher.

Connexions makes heavy use of the Prototype JavaScript framework (version 1.5.0_rc0 or higher) and the Script.aculo.us library built upon it (version 1.6.1 or higher) -- js/{prototype.js,scriptaculous}

In addition, the following are used:
  * js/autosuggest.js
  * js/jslog.js
  * lib/adodb
  * lib/freetag
  * lib/Services_JSON.php
